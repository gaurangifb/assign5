    <h1>HTML AND NETWORKING</h1>
        <p>Internet is a global system to inter connect computer network. We can connect our computer to
            another computer anywhere either in India or abroad . Internet is a wide area network which allow a user
            to access data of information , stored on web and it provide number of facilities like email , web, chat, social
            network, online registration etc.</p>
    
        <p>It began in 1970’s and 1980’s. The Internet as we know it today began as the ARPANET
            (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) built by a division of the Department of Defence. Many local
            area networks connected to the ARPANET with TCP/IP. TCP-Transmission Control Protocol/IP-Internet
            Protocol was developed in 1974.</p>

        <h2>Networking</h2>
        <p>A group of two almost computer inter connected by the telephone lines co axial cabal, satellite,
            links, radio, microwave etc. Some other combination techniques are called networking.</p>

        <h2>Domain Name System</h2>
        <p>The domain name system (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for
            computers, services, or any resource connected to the private network. It associates information with
            domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates easily
            memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating computer
            services and devices worldwide. By providing a worldwide, distributed keyword-based redirection service,
            the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet.</p>

        <p>The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet
            protocol suite for relaying datagram across network boundaries. Its routing function enables
            internetworking, and essentially establishes the Internet.</p>

        <p>World Wide Web (WWW) is a set of program standards to allow a user to access web pages
            governed by the protocols where you can create or access your websites containing text, images, graphics,
            audio and video. Websites are the files created and displayed on web and accessed though hyperlinks
            supported by HTTP protocol.</p>

        <p>A web server is a remote database which provides information to the user via web browsers
            requested. We might be connected to internet through an ISP which provides we the connectivity and a page
            on net we request then it opens to our web server has a web address which is needed to access certain web
            page.</p>

        <p>Web client is web browser, for eg. chrome, mozilla, internet explorer, edge etc. web client / web
            browser is a computer applications running on a user's computer and connect to a server. A Web client / web
            browser contains two parts: Dynamic Web pages and the Web browser.</p>

        <p>The documents which contain combination of computer data, including graphics, sounds, text,
            videos, multimedia and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page. Each website
            has its own unique address which let a user to access the web page through client side application known as
            web browsers. We enter the website address in browser URL bar and access the website. Here’s an address

            contain text, hyperlink, videos, audios, images, tables etc. Each web page is identified by a unique web
            address called Uniform Resource Locator (URL).</p>

        <p>A web browser is a program that enables a user to display and interact with text, images,
            sound and other information located on a web page of a website on the World Wide Web. It is a special
            communication program that reads and interprets HTML documents on the World Wide Web. Web browsers
